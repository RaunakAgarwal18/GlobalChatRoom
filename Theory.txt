WebSocket and STOMP (Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) are related but serve different purposes in the context of web communication.

WebSocket:

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection.

It is a low-level protocol that enables bidirectional communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server.

WebSocket is not specific to messaging; rather, it provides a general-purpose communication channel that can be used for various applications, 
including real-time data transfer, gaming, and more.

WebSocket connections are established through a handshake process, and once established, both the client and server can send data to each other at any time.


STOMP (Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol):

STOMP is a messaging protocol designed for communication between clients and message-oriented middleware, often used in the context of message queues 
or publish-subscribe systems.

It operates on top of protocols like WebSocket or other transport protocols, providing a text-based wire protocol for communication.

STOMP defines message formats and commands for subscribing to and publishing messages to various channels or topics.

It is often used in scenarios where real-time updates or messaging between clients and servers are needed, such as in chat applications or systems involving 
event-driven architectures.

In summary, WebSocket is a low-level protocol for establishing a full-duplex communication channel between a client and a server, while STOMP is a higher-level 
messaging protocol that operates on top of WebSocket (or other transport protocols) to facilitate message-based communication in scenarios where real-time messaging 
or event-driven architectures are essential. STOMP defines conventions for message formats, subscriptions, and more, making it easier to implement messaging features 
in web applications.
